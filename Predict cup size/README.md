# A small project I made to learn Machine Learning. 

## Problem
Given a jav actress dataset, I made a model and try to predict the cup size of the actresses depends on height, bust, waist and hips size. 
## Approach 

I used 2 models: *Random Forest* and *K-Nearest Neighbours* to predict and after evaluate, it seemed that these 2 models are not very good with their scores were only 0.43 and 0.35 respectively. 

## Improvement
I will comeback to this project when I study more about Machine Learning.
